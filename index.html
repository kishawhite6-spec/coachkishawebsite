                <h3>Hey. I'm Coach Kisha White.</h3>
                    <p>And let me tell you something. Your dreams are not random. They were planted in you on purpose.</p>
                    <p>But here's what I've learned after years of leading, teaching, serving, and building: Dreams don't grow in chaos. They grow with clarity, structure, and support.</p>
                    <p><strong>That's where I come in.</strong></p>
                    <p>I help purpose-driven professionals, aspiring authors, entrepreneurs, and visionaries stop circling the idea… and start building the plan.</p>
                    <p>Not hustle-until-you-collapse energy. Not burnout culture. Not "grind now, crash later."</p>
                    <p>We do this strategically. We do this holistically. We do this in a way that protects your peace while expanding your capacity.</p>
                    <p class="emphasis">Because success should feel aligned and not exhausting.</p>

                    <p>I don't believe in achievement that costs you your health, your joy, or your relationships.</p>
                    <p><strong>We look at the whole picture:</strong></p>
